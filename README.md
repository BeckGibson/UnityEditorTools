Unity Editor Tools for Artists
Included Tools:
1. Object Spawner - randomly spawn given object in user defined area with user defined scale and rotation ranges.
2. Organise Folder - Takes model files (fbx, obj), texture files (png, jpg, jpeg, tga, tif, tiff), and material files (mat) and organises them into Models, Materials, Textures folders. Creates folders if they're missing. Folders are created under Assets unless the option toggle is turned on.
3. Create material - Auto generate and populate materials with a selected list of textures. Generate materials using either the standard shader, detail texture shader (quest/mobile compatible), or a user selected shader.
4. Auto Assign Materials - Takes a user selected list of model files then searches for material names matching the model's imported material names.
