Unity Editor Tools for Artists
Included Tools:
1. Object Spawner - randomly spawn given object in user defined area with user defined scale and rotation ranges.
2. Organise Folder - Takes model files (fbx, obj), texture files (png, jpg, jpeg, tga, tif, tiff), and material files (mat) and organises them into Models, Materials, Textures folders. Creates folders if they're missing. Folders are created under Assets unless the option toggle is turned on.
